## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 14.0.0
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/shamir-mnemonic-ts.git
   cd shamir-mnemonic-ts
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Run tests to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Project Structure

- `src/` - Source TypeScript files
  - `constants.ts` - SLIP-0039 constants
  - `utils.ts` - Utility functions and error classes
  - `wordlist.ts` - Wordlist management
  - `rs1024.ts` - RS1024 checksum implementation
  - `cipher.ts` - Feistel cipher for encryption/decryption
  - `share.ts` - Share encoding/decoding
  - `shamir.ts` - Core Shamir secret sharing algorithms
  - `recovery.ts` - Interactive recovery state management
  - `index.ts` - Public API exports
- `tests/` - Test files
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript output (generated)

## Code Standards

### TypeScript Style

- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Use TypeScript strict mode conventions
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

### Code Formatting

- Maintain consistency with existing code formatting
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Follow the existing naming conventions (camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes)

### Comments and Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Explain complex algorithms or non-obvious code
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### Tests

- All new features must include tests
- Tests should cover both success and error cases
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Run `npm test` before submitting

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Follow the code standards above
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Ensure tests pass**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run test:vectors
   ```

4. **Build the project** to ensure it compiles:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Commit your changes**:
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Reference related issues in commit messages (e.g., "Fix #123")

6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Provide a clear description of your changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Explain why the change is needed
   - Include any breaking changes or migration notes

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- One feature or fix per PR
- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Be responsive to review feedback
- Update your PR if requested

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run test vectors
npm run test:vectors
```

### Writing Tests

- Place test files in the `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both positive and negative cases
- Ensure tests are deterministic and don't rely on external state

### Test Coverage

- Aim to maintain or improve test coverage
- New code should have corresponding tests
- Critical paths (like cryptographic operations) should have comprehensive tests

## Important Notes

### SLIP-0039 Compatibility

This project implements the SLIP-0039 standard. When making changes:

- **Maintain binary compatibility** with the SLIP-0039 specification
- **Do not break** existing mnemonic format compatibility
- **Test thoroughly** with the provided test vectors
- **Document** any deviations or extensions to the standard

### Security Considerations

This project handles cryptographic operations. Please:

- Be extra careful with security-related changes
- Review cryptographic code thoroughly
- Consider security implications of any changes
- Report security issues privately if needed

## Getting Help

If you need help or have questions:

- Open an issue on GitHub for questions
- Check existing issues and discussions
- Review the README.md for usage examples

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We aim to maintain a welcoming and inclusive community.
